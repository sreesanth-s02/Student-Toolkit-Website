    <p>
      By using StudentToolKit, you agree to the following simple terms. If you do not agree with
      these terms, please do not use the website.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational Use Only</h2>
    <p>
      StudentToolKit is provided for educational and personal use by students. The CGPA, attendance
      and timetable calculators are helper tools and are not official results. Always confirm your
      marks, credits and attendance with your college or university.
    </p>

    <h2>No Guarantees</h2>
    <p>
      The developer tries to keep the tools accurate and up to date, but there is no guarantee that
      all information or calculations are correct. StudentToolKit is provided “as is” without any
      warranties. You are responsible for how you use the results.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      The developer of StudentToolKit will not be liable for any loss, damage, or consequences
      arising from the use of this website, including mistakes in calculations or decisions taken
      based on the tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>
      You agree not to misuse the website, attempt to break its security, or use it to harass or
      harm others. You also agree not to copy the website design or code and present it as your own
      commercial product without permission.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These terms may be updated from time to time. Your continued use of the site after changes are
      posted means you accept the updated terms.
